## Experience

Managing the querys gave me a headache, but I was happy with the result once I was done. Then I realized I should have read the description of the assignment more closely and worked with a .promise() function, but at that point, it was too late. The assignement allowed me to learn more about mySQL and put it to use.

## Credits

We worked on this homework challenge as a class during office hours. I also used these websites for db.query's language: https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/mysql-language-structure.php and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-syntax.htm.
